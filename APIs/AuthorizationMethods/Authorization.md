# Authorization
- process that determines what an authenticated user, application, or device is permitted to do or access within the API
- answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?, and dictates what you can do once your identity is confirmed
- typically occurs after successful authentication and involves checking permissions based on roles, scopes, or policies
- Example:
    - an authenticated user might be authorized to read data but not modify it
    - an administrator might have full read and write access
